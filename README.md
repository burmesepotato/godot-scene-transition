# godot-scene-transition 🎬


## ✨ Overview

This is an experimental Godot project of mine, exploring how to add buttery-smooth fade transitions between scenes in Godot.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone** this repo.  
2. **Open** in Godot.
3. **Test** the example scenes (living room, space, flowers).
4. **Copy/Paste** whichever scripts from here to fit your project.

### Good luck coding your games too! 🍻
